5.Use the Rekognition API to analyze the images. You can use one of the following services:
6.DetectLabels: This service identifies objects and scenes in an image and returns a list of labels and their confidence scores.
7.DetectModerationLabels: This service detects inappropriate content in images and returns a list of moderation labels.
8.DetectFaces: This service detects faces in an image and returns information about facial attributes, such as gender, age, and emotions.
8.RecognizeCelebrities: This service detects celebrities in an image and returns their names.


It's important to note that AWS Image Rekognition is a powerful tool that can help you automate many tasks that would be difficult or impossible to do manually. However, it's also important to use it responsibly and ethically, and to respect the privacy of individuals whose images you may be analyzing.
